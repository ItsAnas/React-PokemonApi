# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

Learn how react works.
Build something.
Have fun.

If some of you have some experiences on react, don't hesitate to create an issue and give me feedback on it with what's good, what's bad or what could be improved,
especially with architecture, javascript tricks, etc.

I will not add any feature to this project.

Things I wanted to do:

- Website with a static navbar
- Fetch some data
- Have a good UI on both mobile and desktop

## Demo âœ¨

https://itsanas.github.io/React-PokemonApi/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

> You can add the --prod flag (I think it improves performances)

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
